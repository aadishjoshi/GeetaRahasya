Dhritarashtra said, "O Sanjaya, after my sons and the sons of Pandu assembled in the place of pilgrimage at Kurukshetra, desiring to fight, what did they do?".

Sanjaya said, "after looking over the army arranged in the military formation by the sons of Pandu, King Duryodhana then approached his teacher and spoke the following words"

O Teacher, behold this great army of the sons of Pandu, so expertly arrayed by your disciple, the son of Drupada.

Here in this army are many mighty archers, equal in fighting to Bhima and Arjuna, great fighters like Yuyudhana, Virata and Drupada.

There are also great, heroic, powerful fighters like Dhrshtaketu, Chekitana and the Kasiraja, Purujit, and Kuntibhoja and Saibya.

They are the mighty Yudhamanyu and very powerful Uttamaujas, the son of Subhadra, and the sons of Draupadi. All of great chariots.

But for your information, O best of the brahmanas, the names of those who are the most qualified amongst ourselves, the leaders of my army!.

There are personalities like yourself, Bhishma, Karna and Kripa, the victorious in war; Asvatthama, Vikarna, and Jayadratha, the son of Somadatta.

And also many other heroes who have given up their lives for my sake All of them are well armed with various weapons and all well skilled in battle.

Our strength is immeasurable, and we are perfectly protected by Bhishma, whereas the strenth of the Pandavas, carefully protected by Bhima is limited.
